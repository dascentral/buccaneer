# Buccaneer

## Introduction

This repository represents my efforts to bootstrap the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) framework. It provides an additional set of styles and utilities that I leverage within the web applications that I build.

Real-world applications are likely to have a unique visual design that may or may not benefit from the use of this framework.


## Why "Buccaneer"?

I attended [Milford High School](https://mhs.milfordschooldistrict.org/) in Milford, DE - home of the Buccaneers!
